Puzzle Games 2013 (PG13) Vision Statement
==========================

PG13 is a social application for building, sharing and solving various word puzzles. 
These puzzles include, but are not exclusive to: word searches, crosswords and 
cryptograms. Users will be able create, share and solve a variety of puzzles at their 
leisure. 

PG13 has a target audience of puzzle enthusiasts. Our application allows enthusiasts
to quickly access and solve a range of puzzles. For the enthusiasts that like to create,
our application will allow them to easily create and share their puzzles with the 
world. 
PG13 will also be useful for teachers, who will be able to use our application to 
create educational puzzles that can be solved by their students. The other benefit 
for teachers is that they will be able to share their puzzles with other educators and 
students can benefit from sharing their own puzzles amongst each other. 

In the future, we hope to expand PG13 so it can connect with real social networks, 
such as Facebook and Twitter. 
PG13 gives users quick access to a larger selection of puzzles than what they can 
find in current media outlets, such as the newspaper. Users can also choose puzzles 
that are at their level as opposed to the limited options in the newspaper. Puzzles are
a great way for teachers to teach their curriculum whilst keeping students 
interested. Some teachers already see the value in puzzles and create them by hand 
for their classes. Our application makes this process faster and easier. The social 
aspect can create competition and interactivity between students. Puzzlers can take 
advantage of the social aspect of PG13 as well and compete with each other for high 
scores. Puzzles are healthy and keep the mind young and active! 

We would like to have 5000 users registered, and 10000 puzzles created in the next 
year. In five years time, we aim to have our application used by 10% of schools in 
Winnipeg.
