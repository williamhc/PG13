Task: Puzzle Creation UI Design
Hours: 1
Description: Alright I thought some more and got a mockup for creating puzzles. I
think it could use some other eyes for sure. The other UIs would be laid out
similar if it makes sense (it does for searching and playing at least - maybe not).
See the attached PDFs and ask if there are any questions. If you guys have want to
work on it in Balsamiq (the webapp is free iirc) I added the .bmml file too.
